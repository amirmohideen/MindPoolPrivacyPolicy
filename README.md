**Last Updated:** February 17, 2026  
**Platform:** Meta Quest 2, Quest Pro, Quest 3, and Meta Horizon OS  

MindPool is an XR mind-mapping and note-taking application developed by **10XVAR**. We prioritize your privacy and are committed to transparency regarding data use.

## 1. Data Collection and Use

To provide functionality on the Meta Horizon platform, MindPool processes the following categories of data:

### A. Meta Platform Data (Required for App Functionality)

* **User ID:** A unique numeric identifier provided by Meta. This is used locally to distinguish save files and manage app settings for individual users on the same device.
* **User Profile Information:** Basic display name and profile picture may be accessed to personalize the in-app workspace or avatar identity.

> Meta Platform Data (such as User ID or profile information) is processed locally and is **not shared with third-party AI providers.**

---

### B. User-Generated Content (Stored Locally)

The following data is created and controlled entirely by the user:

* Mind maps, notes, text, and node structures  
* Website URLs and browser state used within the app  
* App preferences and session state  
* AI prompt text entered by the user  

All User-Generated Content is stored locally on your Quest headset as JSON files.  
10XVAR does **not** upload, access, or store your notes, mind maps, or URLs on external servers.

## 2. AI Processing and Third-Party Service (Groq API)

MindPool includes an AI avatar feature powered by the **Groq API**, which runs the Llama 3.3 model.

When you interact with the AI avatar:

* Only the **text you voluntarily enter** is transmitted to Groq.
* **Meta Platform Data (User ID, profile information)** is NOT transmitted to Groq.
* Session JSON files, mind maps, and locally stored app data are NOT automatically shared with Groq.
* Data is transmitted solely to generate a real-time response.
* We do not store, log, or use your AI conversations for advertising or profiling.
* We do not sell or monetize your prompts or responses.

Groq acts as a data processor strictly for the purpose of generating AI responses under our instructions.

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

* **Local Storage:** Mind maps, preferences, and URLs are stored locally on your Quest device as JSON files.
* **User ID Association:** The User ID is used locally to associate your saved content with your profile on the device.
* **Retention Period:** Data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app.

10XVAR does not maintain remote databases of your personal content.

## 4. User Rights and Data Deletion

You may:

1. **Delete Local Data:** Use “Clear App Data” in Quest Settings or uninstall the app.
2. **Request Metadata Clarification or Deletion:** If you have questions about how your Meta Platform Data is processed, you may contact us.

## 5. Web Browsing

MindPool allows in-app browsing of external websites. When accessing third-party websites, your data is governed by the privacy policies of those respective sites.

10XVAR does not collect or log your browsing history beyond what is stored locally for session continuity.

MindPool:

* Does NOT sell user data.
* Does NOT share Meta User ID or profile data with Groq.
